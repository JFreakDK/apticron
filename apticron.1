.SH DESCRIPTION
.B apticron
is a shell script which generates a mail with a list of all packages
currently pending an upgrade, as well as summary of changes
- using apt-listchanges - to a configurable Email address.

.B apticron
is mainly intended for automatic notification of pending security
updates but can also be used in many other situations where timely
updates are necessary.

The \fB--cron\fR option is only meant to be used when invoked by
cron in order to run no more than once a day.

upgraded. It's inconvenient, but it's not a bug in apticron itself. Please see
