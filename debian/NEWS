apticron (1.1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  New config option added: NOTIFY_NEW.# Set NOTIFY_NEW="0" if you don't want to
  be notified about packages which are not installed in your system. Yes, it's
  possible! There are some issues related to systems which have mixed
  stable/unstable sources. In these cases apt-get will consider for example that
  packages with "Priority: required"/"Essential: yes" in unstable but not in
  stable should be installed, so they will be listed in dist-upgrade output.
  Please take a look at

apticron (1.1.32) unstable; urgency=low

  New config option added: NOTIFY_HOLDS. This determines whether apticron will
  download/list packages on hold or not. The default behavior is notifying these
  packages. If you don't want to be mailed about new versions of packages on
  hold in your system, please set NOTIFY_HOLDS="0" in your apticron config
  file.

apticron (1.1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  This release introduces a new option (--cron) and a cron.d snippet to run
  apticron once a day at a time randomly generated during postinst.
  The cron.daily script still remains mainly for those systems that aren't up
  24h a day. Note however that the random sleep has been removed, so not to
  delay execution of following jobs.
  If you wish, you can modify the time in the cron.d file, but be advised that
  the first execution could be triggered by the cron.daily script (as also the
  first execution after the installation of this release). Subsequent runs
  should go fine. Note however that execution time has been randomized in
  order not to DOS Debian servers, so please don't modify it unless strongly
  needed.
