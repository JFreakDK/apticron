apticron (1.1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  This release introduces a new option (--cron) and a cron.d snippet to run
  apticron once a day at a time randomly generated during postinst.
  The cron.daily script still remains mainly for those systems that aren't up
  24h a day. Note however that the random sleep has been removed, so not to
  delay execution of following jobs.
  If you wish, you can modify the time in the cron.d file, but be advised that
  the first execution could be triggered by the cron.daily script (as also the
  first execution after the installation of this release). Subsequent runs
  should go fine. Note however that execution time has been randomized in
  order not to DOS Debian servers, so please don't modify it unless strongly
  needed.
